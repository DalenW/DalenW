I’m @DalenW

Right now I do a lot of work with Ruby on Rails. While the majority of my contributions calender is green, most of it is due to private work I do. Probably all of the public repos here are from when I was in High School / University, so they're crap. Currently, I'm working on a portfolio project called Manius Market. It's a Rails app that represents what I can do. It's in the very beginning stages so there isn't much to look at yet. 

You can reach me via email at dalen.ward@m6securities.com. I sometimes do paid dev work.
